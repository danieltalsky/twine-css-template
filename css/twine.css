	Twine CSS Template
	
	Simple CSS Template to help Twine authors change 
		the default appearance
		
	Most current version, and license information at:
	https://github.com/danieltalsky/twine-css-template
	
	Special thanks to furkle's Twine 2 Harlowe CSS Tutorial
	no longer up on the web but helped a lot with the basics.
	
	- Version:  1.0
	- Author:   Daniel Talsky <daniel@danieltalsky.com>

	
	COLORS

	The default colors I picked are based on the Solarized Dark theme, 
	optimized for readability and most often used in computer programming.
	Change them to make your game have whatever mood you want, just make
	sure it's readable!

	- background  				#002b36
	- sidebar background   		#073642
	
	- main text color 			#839496
	- main sidebar text color   #93a1a1

	FONTS
	
	You can use a traditional HTML font stack, but having access to
	unique fonts keeps your game looking unique.  I picked 
	PT Sans Caption, but you can pick any combination of google fonts
	and they will generate this import line for you.
	
	Google Fonts:
	https://fonts.google.com/

/* These are the default options for the each passage area */
tw-passage {
	/* 
		This lets the story take up most of its width up to a maximum readable width

		It's ok to experiment with making this smaller or larger

/*
	EFFECTS

	The pulse-in effect is good for text that will appear based on a user
	action.  In Twine2, text will just blink into being and the user might
	not notice.  If you wrap your text in:
	<span class="pulse-in">Text that gets shown.</span>
	
	It will appear with a bright colored pulse that makes it clear it just
	appeared.
*/

  from { color: #00fbf7; text-shadow: 0 0 1em #00fbf7; }
