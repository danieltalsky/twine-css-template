# Twine CSS Template

### A Simple CSS Template to Help Customize the Basic Twine Template

Twine2 is a great tool for beginners to make games, but there aren't customization options out of the box, and the way to use CSS is not well documented.  This template is a well-commented basic reset that allows you to make your game look unique without knowing too much about CSS.

## How to Use

Cut and paste the CSS template into Twine2's CSS Section

Modify fonts and colors to your liking following the instructions in the CSS, or just use as-is, an extremely readable basic template.
