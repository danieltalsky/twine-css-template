# Twine CSS Template

### A Simple CSS Template to Help Customize Twine2 Games

Twine2 is a great tool for beginners to make games, but there aren't customization options out of the box, and the way to use CSS is not well documented.  This template is a well-commented basic reset that allows you to make your game look unique without knowing too much about CSS.

## How to Use

Cut and paste the CSS template into Twine2's CSS Section

Modify fonts and colors to your liking following the instructions in the CSS, or just use as-is, an extremely readable basic template.

## Notes

Right now, there is only a template for customizing Harlowe games. I'm
working on a template for SugarCube, but until then, use the official
basic template, called Bleached: http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/
